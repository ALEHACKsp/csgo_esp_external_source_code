Annoying not completely transparent overlay.
You need to play in windowed full screen.

Hold CTRL to lock on target's head when ur near his crosshair.

Also included AHK script:
F1 to enable Bunny Hopping, then hold space,
F2 to enable 1 tapping (hold Middle mouse -> different speeds for different guns/crouching with alt)
F3 to enable bursting, (right click to toggle)
F4+ for different guns Anti recoil patterns.
