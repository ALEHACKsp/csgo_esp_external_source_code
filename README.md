I using offsets from hazedumper
Repo : https://github.com/frk1/hazedumper
Hazedumper is search patterns and finding offets.

Then, you can get quick update as yourself for esp. 

If ESP not working:
1. start csgo.exe with -inscure parameter
2. start a game with bots
3. start hazedumper.exe as administrator
4. restart this app

script:
NUM1 - AIM HACK ON/OFF
NUM2 - WEAPONS ICONS ON/OFF

Annoying not completely transparent overlay.
You need to play in windowed full screen.
